## Our Mission
Letâ€™s together make learning joyful

We are building a personalized, adaptive and gamified learning platform for students, teachers and parents.

## Our Journey

Back in 2006, Basant Pandey was serving as a teacher at Central School in Port Blair. He observed that students lacked accessibility to good study material. Books and study materials would take 15-20 days to reach the state as ships would run only twice a month between the mainland and the island.

He discussed the idea with his brother Vinod Pandey, a final-year engineering student. They created a website on a free hosting server and uploaded sample papers and study material.

As popularity grew, they launched myCBSEguide.com in 2007 as a platform to provide free study material to CBSE students in the form of syllabus, sample question papers, board exam papers, online tests, quick revision notes, important questions, news and updates.

From 2006 to 2016, myCBSEguide remained an active hobby project. Both worked on this project on weekends and after office hours. The website was regularly updated with the latest study material.

## Products

In 2016, both brothers quit their jobs and started working full-time. They worked on two different products for students and teachers:

(1) myCBSEguide - It provides study material and learning assessment tools to students and parents. Today, myCBSEguide is one of the most trusted learning apps among CBSE students.  

(2) Examin8 - It helps schools, coaching institutes, teachers and tutors create question papers and online tests in minutes using the huge databank of questions uploaded on their servers.
